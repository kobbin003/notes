Error boundary:

It is created to handle ui error.
It keeps the react from rendering empty page, which is a very bad ux.

- error boundary is a react component.
- It can only be a class component, cant be a function component.
- inside the class component there is a static method called getDerivedStateFromError(), which runs when the component or its children gets error.
