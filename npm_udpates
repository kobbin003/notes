npm updates:

- npm list -> lists all the packages with its current installed version.

- npm outdated -> lists all the outdated package with it's current installed and latest available version in a tabular fashion.

- npm update --save/--save-dev --> ***not working for me.

- use npm-check-updates: npm i -g npm-check-updates
Then use these commands:

1. ncu    -> Checks for updates from the package.json file
2. ncu -u ->Update the package.json file
3. npm install -> update installed packages and package-lock.json/
[npm update --save --> Update your package-lock.json file from the package.json file]
