strictquery: 
When strict option is set to true , Mongoose will ensure that only the fields that are specified in your Schema will be saved in the database, and all other fields will not be saved (if some other fields are sent). In simple term, the strict option, ensures that values passed to our model constructor that were not specified in our schema do not get saved to the db.
